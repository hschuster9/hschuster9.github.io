    <p class="aboutParagraph"> Growing up during a time when the Internet quickly changed our lives, I was always fascinated by the rapid growth of technology. I found myself constantly researching the latest advancements to learn as much as I could about each one. <p> After realizing that the tech industry is more than an interest, I took the leap into web development and have not looked back. I am passionate about learning exactly what goes into creating well-designed and responsive websites.  With a background in Business, I understand the importance of collaboration in order to build large scale applications. <p> Every day is a new challenge and I'm eager to continue exploring the endless possibilites in web development.  </p>
