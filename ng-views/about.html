    <p class="aboutParagraph"> Growing up during a time when technology quickly changed our lives, I have always been curious about the design and aesthetics of new products. I found myself constantly researching the latest advancements to learn as much as I could about each one. <p> After realizing that the tech industry is more than an interest, I took the leap into web development. From rendering my first, “Hello World”, to building multiple full-stack applications, I have been amazed by the web's capabilities. I am very passionate about learning exactly what goes into creating well-designed and responsive websites. With a background in Business, I also understand the importance of collaboration in order to build large scale applications. <p> Every day is a new challenge and I am eager to continue exploring the endless possibilites in web development. <p> Outside of coding, I enjoy cooking for others, going to spinning classes, and finding ways to entertain my energetic dog in a busy city.  </p>
